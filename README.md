A simple text-based RPG that can be played in the developer console of your browser that served as an excersise in using
constructors. No HTML and CSS at work here, but there's a good bit of javascript to be played with. Check out main.js 
and see if you can't decipher the madness to play a quick little game and fight some NEW undead() monsters.
